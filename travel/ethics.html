<center><h2>Travel Ethics</h2></center>
  
<a id="annoying"></a>DON'T BE ANNOYING<br>
<ul>
<li>Don’t be an arrogant jerk. You are a guest. Be modest, don’t assume you are better or wiser than the locals. Obey local norms and behaviour, including dress code. Don’t criticize things you know nothing about.
<li>Don't get upset when someone is not fluent in your language. Speak slowly so that others can understand you. Try to learn some of the local language.
<li>In many cultures it is rude to take photos of strangers. They may be too polite to object, but it can be very annoying to be treated as a tourist attraction. 
<li>"Slum tours", "child photography": do you walk around your hometown and take photos of children and homeless people? Why do it in India or Kenya?
<li>Respect ancient sites. Do not take "souvenirs" (pebbles, rocks) from the site. Do not touch sculptures or paintings as that slowly damages them.
<li>Don't litter, even if some locals do it. Minimize your use of plastic. Most developing countries lack the facilities to recycle or safely dispose plastic so it ends up polluting the environment. 
</ul>
<a id="spending"></a><p>SPENDING MONEY</p>
<ul>
<li>In developing countries, support the local economy. Avoid foreign-owned hotels and restaurants, buy locally produced goods, support traditional skills. Give less popular establishments a chance.
<li>Luxury uses up a lot of resources. This comes with negative effects: 1. destruction of the environment (logging, mining, pollution, waste); 2. Local people can no longer afford some of these resources (e.g. housing, clean water, electricity). Sometimes indigenous people are displaced to make space for your resort. You are giving money to a very rich class in the tourism business, not to ordinary people. 
<li>Human/animal exploitation, drugs, products made from endangered species, stolen artifacts: don't create a demand for them.
<li>Giving money to scammers, corrupt officials, dishonest sellers makes the problem worse. These people are very rich by local standards.
<li>Bargaining is expected in many parts of the world. Don't overpay as it contributes to inflation which makes life less affordable for locals.
<li>Don’t bargain too far. The seller may be desperate to earn some money, but paying 4$ for handicraft that took a whole day to make is disgraceful.
<li>Traffic and pollution are making many cities unlivable. By driving a private car or taxi you become part of the problem.
<li>Cars, planes, and cruise ships harm the environment more than other means of transport (per distance per passenger).
</ul>
<a id="beggars"></a><p>BEGGARS</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be difficult to always remain cold-hearted when approached by disfigured people or street children, seeing that some of them are indeed desperately poor. However, there are many reasons why you shouldn't give them money: it discourages them from finding a job or getting medical treatment, it discourages parents from sending their kids to school, it teaches them to harass every tourist they see, they may spend your money on drugs and cigarettes, they may not be poor at all... 
<li>On the other hand, when a similar argument is made against welfare spending in rich countries (e.g. that unemployment benefits or disability pensions demotivate people), most people in these countries disagree. The pension that someone in a rich country receives could save perhaps a hundred people in a poor country. 
<li>NGOs and government programs that are supposed to help the poor are often corrupt or come with a political/religious agenda and many people remain without any help at all. Hence, giving money directly to beggars might not always be a bad way of helping those in need. However, donating to a reputable, secular charity that fights disease and poverty seems safer to me. When done right, it does not create dependence on handouts to the same degree and can eliminate the cause of poverty for some people. Besides, as a foreign traveler it is difficult to make the right call about who really needs your help and who doesn't. A charity evaluator (e.g. <a href="https://www.givewell.org/" target=_blank>GiveWell</a>) can help find cost-effective charities.
<li>If you must, give food instead of money and not to people who harass you. Even better: get a ride in a rickshaw, pay a shoe-shiner, buy something from street vendors, leave a nice tip for good service.
<li>In rural areas you may get surrounded by a group of kids asking for money or sweets. Most likely they're not real beggars but are playing a kind of game where they occasionally get rewarded. Be nice, maybe joke around a little, but don't encourage begging. You can do much better by buying something from adults.
</ul>
<a id="volun"></a><p>VOLUNTEERING</p>
<ul>
<li>Be skeptical about any volunteering program that costs money to participate. If you have to pay in order to work, then most likely your work has little or no value and only your money matters. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, sometimes it may be a scheme to exploit the people you are "helping" (e.g. "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/orphanage-tourism" target=_blank>orphanage tourism</a>"). 
<li>While the work you do may indeed benefit your host, if it doesn't require any prior skill then you are denying work opportunities to local unemployed people who can't compete with free labour. 
<li>If you genuinely want to help, the best way is to become skilled in an area that lacks funding in many poor countries (e.g. health professional, teacher, scientist, search and rescue professional).
<li>Missionaries: How would you feel about having groups of foreigners in <i>your</i> hometown, teaching children and poor people about their foreign religion and their foreign family values, promising redemption and eternal life?
