<center><h2>Preparation</h2></center>
Planning:<br>
<ul>
<li>What are the entry requirements? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Visa_requirements">visas</a>, permits, <a href="health.html">vaccinations</a>...)<br>
<li>What is the current situation? (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/" target=_blank>holidays</a>, <a href="https://www.electionguide.org/elections/type/upcoming/" target=_blank>elections</a>, violence, <a href="http://www.gdacs.org/" target=_blank>disasters</a>...). Check news and <a href="resources.html#advis">travel advisory pages</a> if not sure about safety.<br>
<li>What weather <a href="http://climatemaps.romgens.com/" target=_blank>can you expect</a>? Will you be at a <a href="health.html">high altitude</a>?<br>
<li>If going to multiple countries, how will you cross the borders? Are <a href="borders.html">land crossings</a> open to tourists? Can you get <a href="visas.html">visas outside your home country</a>?<br>
<li>How will you <a href="money.html">handle money</a>? Can you use local ATMs?<br>
</ul>
Also:
<ul>
<li>Write down important information (bank card numbers, passwords, plane tickets) using a secret code that only you can solve. Email it to yourself, along with scans of important documents.
<li>Print out a few maps and notes about the places you want to visit.
<li>It can be useful to carry a printed copy of your passport.
</ul>  
<center><h2>Travel budget</h2></center>
These budgets should be sufficient for independent travel. Costs don't include flights or expensive entertainment (adventure sports, bars...). Worst-case scenario (injury, theft...) is not considered. Range mostly reflects price differences between countries.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Luxury tourist:</b>
<ul>
<li>Budget: at least 400 $/week (all-inclusive)<br>
- Transport: Rented car or tour bus<br>
- Accommodation: Resort or hotel<br>
- Food: At the resort/hotel<br>
<li>Places to go: Stay in resort or hire a guide to go sightseeing<br>
<li>What to pack: Anything you want<br>
<li>Experience: Enjoy the luxury surrounded by other tourists and learn nothing about local life.<br>
</ul>
<b>2. Road trip:</b>
<ul>
<li>Budget: 80-850 $/week <br>
- Transport: 40-300 $/week (car/motorbike)<br>
- Accommodation: 0-250 $/week (camping/hostel/hotel)<br>
- Food: 20-150 $/week (restaurant or groceries)<br>
- Other costs: 20-150 $/week (visas, museums...)<br>
<li>Places to go: Anywhere accessible by road<br>
<li>What to pack: Camping gear, stove, spare parts, etc.<br>
<li>Experience: You have your own schedule, but you give up the freedom to switch between modes of transport, some of which may be more convenient than the one you're stuck with. If you go hiking, you must always return to your starting point. You alienate yourself and miss most of the local experience. Pick up hitchhikers so you don't feel lonely.<br>
</ul>
