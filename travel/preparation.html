<li>If going to multiple countries, how will you cross the borders? <a href="borders.html">Are land crossings open to tourists?</a> If not, are the flights expensive? <a href="visas.html">Can you apply for visas outside your home country?</a><br>

</ul>
Also:
<ul>
<li>Write down important information (bank card numbers, passwords, plane tickets) using a code that only you can solve. Email it to yourself, along with scans of important documents.
<li>Print out a few maps and notes about the places you want to visit. A printed map can easily fit in your pocket and is less conspicuous than a guidebook or a phone or a big tourist map in your hand.
<li>Sometimes it is good to carry a printed copy of your passport.
