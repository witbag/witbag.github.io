<center><h2>A few ways to travel</h2></center>
<br>
All of these can be enjoyable in their own way. To do #1-3 you need money. To do #4 you need to be relatively fit and in good health.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Luxury tourist:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight + rented car or tour bus
<li>Accommodation: Resort or hotel
<li>Food: At the resort/hotel
<li>Places to go: Stay in resort or hire a guide to go sightseeing
<li>What to pack: Anything you want
<li>Experience: Enjoy the luxury surrounded by other tourists and learn nothing about local life. In poor countries the money you spend can have a big impact, <a href="ethics.html#spending">sometimes a bad one</a>.
<li>Budget: at least 400 $/week
</ul>
<b>2. Road trip/cruise:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Car/motorbike/sail
<li>Accommodation: Camping or paid
<li>Food: Restaurant or groceries
<li>Places to go: Anywhere accessible by road or sea
<li>What to pack: Camping gear, stove, spare parts, etc.
<li>Experience: You have more independence schedule-wise, but you give up the freedom to switch between modes of transport, some of which may be more convenient than the one you're stuck with. If you go hiking, you must always return to your starting point. You alienate yourself and miss most of the local experience. Pick up hitchhikers so you don't feel lonely.
<li>Budget: 100-600 $/week
</ul>
<b>3. Backpacker:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Public transport/walk. Sometimes rent a bicycle or a motorbike. Avoid taxis as much as possible (<a href="transport.html">read more</a>)
<li>Accommodation: Hostel/budget hotel/stay with friends/couchsurfing. Overnight bus or train (<a href="accommodation.html">read more</a>)
<li>Food: Restaurant or groceries
<li>Places to go: Anywhere accessible by road
<li>What to pack: A small bag. Something to read. Bring camping gear only if you plan on camping. (<a href="packing.html">packing suggestions</a>)
<li>Experience: Depends on your attitude and your luck (tip: be flexible and improvise).
<li>Budget: 100-600 $/week (<a href="money.html">advice on handling money</a>)
</ul>
<b>4. Adventurer/explorer/hobo:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Walk/hitchhike/bicycle/kayak/horseback/etc (<a href="transport.html">hitchhiking tips</a>)
<li>Accommodation: Camping, squatting, couchsurfing (<a href="accommodation.html">advice on camping</a>). If you worry about not showering, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/i-stopped-showering-and-life-continued/486314" target=_blank>read here.</a>
<li>Food: Groceries, foraging, dumpster diving.
<li>Places to go: Anywhere, but this is the best way to see real wilderness that others can't access. Be aware that in some countries you can't visit national parks without a guide and/or an expensive enterance ticket.
<li>What to pack: If traveling alone, bring a bivy/hammock/tarp instead of a tent. Leave enough space in your bag for food and water. (<a href="packing.html">packing suggestions</a>)
<li>Experience: You will suffer but you will have a chance to visit places out of reach for other travelers.
<li>Budget: 0-200 $/week (<a href="money.html">advice on handling money</a>)
</ul>
