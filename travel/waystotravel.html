<center><h2>A few ways to travel</h2></center>
  
<b>1. Luxury tourist:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight + rented car or tour bus
<li>Accommodation: Resort or hotel
<li>Food: At the resort/hotel
<li>Places to see: Stay in resort or hire a guide to go sightseeing
<li>What to pack: Anything you want
<li>Experience: Enjoy the luxury surrounded by other tourists and learn nothing about local life. In poor countries the money you spend can have a big impact, both good and bad (<a href="ethics.html">read about responsible travel...</a>)
<li>Budget: at least 500 $/week
</ul>
<b>2. Road trip/cruise:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Car/motorbike/sail
<li>Accommodation: Camping or paid
<li>Food: Restaurant, groceries, cook by yourself
<li>Places to see: Anywhere accessible by road or sea
<li>What to pack: Camping gear, spare parts, etc.
<li>Experience: You have more independence schedule-wise, but you give up the freedom to switch between modes of transport, some of which may be more convenient than the one you're stuck with. If you go hiking, you must always return to your starting point. You alienate yourself and miss most of the local experience. Pick up hitchhikers so you don't feel lonely.
<li>Budget: 100-600 $/week
</ul>
<b>3. Backpacker:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Flight/public transport. Sometimes rent a motorbike or bicycle. Private taxi only as a last resort. (<a href="transport.html">read more</a>)
<li>Accommodation: Hostel or budget hotel. Overnight bus or train. Sometimes stay with friends or couchsurfing (<a href="accommodation.html">read more</a>)
<li>Food: Restaurant or groceries
<li>Places to see: Anywhere accessible by road
<li>What to pack: A small bag. Something to read. Don't bring any camping gear unless you are sure you will be using it. (<a href="packing.html">packing suggestions</a>)
<li>Experience: Depends on your attitude and your luck.
<li>Budget: 100-600 $/week (<a href="money.html">advice on handling money</a>)
</ul>
<b>4. Adventurer/explorer/hobo:</b>
<ul>
<li>Transport: Walk/hitchhike/horseback/bicycle/kayak/etc (<a href="transport.html">hitchhiking tips</a>)
<li>Accommodation: Camping, squatting, couchsurfing (<a href="accommodation.html">advice on camping</a>). If you worry about not showering, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/i-stopped-showering-and-life-continued/486314" target=_blank>read here.</a>
<li>Food: Groceries, foraging, dumpster diving, cook by yourself.
<li>Places to see: Anywhere, but this is the best way to see real wilderness that others can't access. Note that in some countries you can't enter national parks without a guide and/or an expensive enterance ticket.
<li>What to pack: A small bag (large bag if camping in cold climate). If traveling alone, bring a bivy/hammock/tarp instead of a tent. (<a href="packing.html">packing suggestions</a>)
<li>Experience: You will suffer but you will have a chance to visit places out of reach for other travelers.
<li>Budget: 0-200 $/week (<a href="money.html">advice on handling money</a>)
</ul>
All of these can be enjoyable in their own way, although many people can't afford #1-3. #4 can be a great option for both rich and poor people, but you need to be relatively fit and in good health.
