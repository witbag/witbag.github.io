PACKING<br>
<ul>
<li>Unless you are going somewhere extremely remote, you can always buy things at your destination. The only things you really need to bring are your passport and a bank card.
<li>Pack light. Bring a few clothes and handwash them. With a small backpack, you can spend a whole day hiking or exploring a city without ever checking in to a hotel and then take an overnight bus to another city. With a big backpack, you have to get a bus/taxi and look for a hotel every time you arrive in a new place. You will walk slowly, sweating in the sun, and be an obvious target for every tout in the area.
<li>Instead of bringing many warm clothes, put on several layers of tshirts and pants if it gets cold.
<li>Don’t look like a tourist. Avoid expensive-looking clothes, backpack, gadgets, etc. Try to dress like locals do. A big backpack will immediately make you stand out and draw unwanted attention. A cheap, small, normal-looking backpack is much better.
<li>If you need clothes for formal events, try to get versatile ones that can also be worn throughout the day. 
<li>If you choose to buy "outdoor clothing”, find something normal-looking, without a visible logo or reflective parts.
<li>Sneakers or sandals are usually the best shoes for hiking. Hiking boots are heavy, hot, and take long to dry; they’re helpful only on very rough or icy terrain.
<li>Print out a few maps and notes about the places you will visit. A printed map can easily fit in your pocket and is less conspicuous than a guidebook or a phone or a big tourist map in your hand.
<li>People laugh at me for using a compass but it's reliable, fast and doesn't need a battery. Get a tiny one for 1$.
<li>Plug adapters: there are <a href="https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/" target=_blank>many types of sockets</a> but you can survive anywhere with only the "EU" and "US" plugs (and the "AU" plug in a few countries). The "UK" socket can accommodate a EU plug <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi5_CTBnDgc" target=_blank>with a bit of effort</a>. Get a simple, small adapter (<a href="https://www.dhresource.com/0x0s/f2-albu-g5-M01-70-EB-rBVaJFi0KfqAHu21AAEbpXp_5UQ354.jpg/portable-travel-power-plug-adapter-eu-us-au-adaptor-converter-ac-power-plug-european-to-american-outlet-universal.jpg" target=_blank>like this one</a>) as these are the most versatile.
</ul>
GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>People have lived in places like the Andes, the Amazon, or Sahara for thousands of years without Goretex jackets or hiking boots. The only people who you see wearing "outdoor gear" in these places are tourists. Unless you're planning some extreme expedition, you don't need any expensive items. High-tech gear is never as good as advertised and always comes with drawbacks.
<li>That said, if you want to spend money, spend it on lightweight, durable items.
</ul>
CAMPING GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>Only bring camping gear if you are sure you will need it. 
<li>Instead of bringing a tent, consider a bivy bag or a hammock. They are lighter and can be set up in many places where a tent can't be, e.g. a dense forest, a terrace, a boat, under a wagon. Sometimes a mosquito net will be needed. A poncho-tarp can also be useful.
<li>A mattress may be necessary in cold weather (you lose a lot of heat to the ground). Get a small, inflatable one or lie down on your clothes and your backpack.
<li>Make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove" target=_blank>stove from a can</a> (a simple design <a href="https://vimeo.com/64726512" target=_blank>here</a>). Bring along alcohol fuel in small bottles that can go to carry-on. Use a metal mug for cooking and handling food and aluminum foil as a lid. Plastic/wooden spoon and knife (if flying).
</ul>
