<center><h2>Packing</h2></center>
<ul>
<li>Unless you are going somewhere extremely remote, you can always buy things at your destination. The only things you really need to bring are your passport and a bank card.
<li>Pack light. Bring a few clothes and handwash them. With a small backpack, you can spend a whole day hiking or exploring a city without ever checking in to a hotel and then take an overnight bus to another city. With a big backpack, you have to get a bus/taxi and look for a hotel every time you arrive in a new place. You will walk slowly, sweating in the sun, and be an obvious target for every tout in the area.
<li>Instead of bringing many warm clothes, put on several layers of tshirts and pants if it gets cold.
<li>If you need clothes for formal events, try to get versatile ones that can also be worn throughout the day. 
<li>If you choose to buy "outdoor clothing”, find something normal-looking, without a visible logo or reflective parts.
<li>The best shoes for hiking are usually sneakers or sandals. Hiking boots are heavy, hot, and take long to dry; they’re helpful only on very rough or icy terrain.
<li>People laugh at me for using a compass but it's reliable, fast and doesn't need a battery. Get a tiny one for 1$.
<li>Plug adapters: there are <a href="https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/" target=_blank>many types of sockets</a> but you can survive anywhere with only the "EU" and "US" plugs (and the "AU" plug in a few countries). The "UK" socket can accommodate a EU plug <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi5_CTBnDgc" target=_blank>with a bit of effort</a>. Get a simple, small adapter (<a href="https://www.dhresource.com/0x0s/f2-albu-g5-M01-70-EB-rBVaJFi0KfqAHu21AAEbpXp_5UQ354.jpg/portable-travel-power-plug-adapter-eu-us-au-adaptor-converter-ac-power-plug-european-to-american-outlet-universal.jpg" target=_blank>like this one</a>) as these are the most versatile.
</ul>
GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>People have lived in places like the Andes, the Amazon, or Sahara for thousands of years without Goretex jackets or hiking boots. The only people who you see wearing "outdoor gear" in these places are tourists. Unless you're planning some extreme expedition, you don't need any expensive items. High-tech gear is never as good as advertised and always has its drawbacks.
<li>That said, if you want to spend money, spend it on lightweight, durable items.
<li>Get some rain protection. A poncho-tarp is a good lightweight option and can cover you and your backpack. Alteratively, rain jacket + rain skirt or umbrella.
</ul>
CAMPING GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>Don't bring camping gear if you're not sure you will need it. It may be cheaper to rent it on the spot than to travel with bigger luggage.  
<li>Instead of bringing a tent, consider a bivy bag or a hammock. They are lighter and can be set up in many places where a tent can't be, e.g. a dense forest, a terrace, a boat, under a wagon. Sometimes a mosquito net or a tarp will be needed. 
<li>A mattress may be necessary in cold weather (you lose a lot of heat to the ground). Get a small, inflatable one or lie down on your clothes and your empty backpack.
<li>Lightweight cooking: Make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove" target=_blank>stove from a can</a> (a simple design <a href="https://vimeo.com/64726512" target=_blank>here</a>) and use denatured alcohol as fuel (the higher the ethanol content the better). Use a metal mug for cooking and handling food and aluminum foil as a lid.
</ul>
