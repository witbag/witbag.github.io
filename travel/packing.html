<center><h2>Packing</h2></center>
<ul>
<li>Pack light: Bring a few clothes and handwash them. With a small backpack, you can easily spend a whole day hiking or sightseeing and then take an overnight bus to another location. With a big backpack, you will walk slowly, sweating in the sun, and be an obvious target for every tout and every thief in the area.
<li>Instead of bringing too many warm clothes, put on several layers of tshirts and pants if it gets cold.
<li>In case you need formal clothes, try to get versatile ones that can also be worn throughout the day.
<li>Unless you are going somewhere very remote, you can always buy things at your destination. For a long trip, it is better to bring too little than too much stuff. 
<li>In wet weather, keep your things in a garbage bag inside your backpack.
</ul>
GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>People have lived in places like the Andes, the Amazon, or Sahara for thousands of years without Goretex jackets or hiking boots. The only people you see wearing "outdoor gear" in these places are tourists. Unless you're doing some extreme expedition, you don't need any expensive items. High-tech gear is never as good as advertised and always has its drawbacks.
<li>That said, if you want to spend money, spend it on durable, lightweight items.
<li>The best shoes for hiking are usually sneakers or sandals. Unless you're on snow or in a jungle, hiking boots have mostly downsides: they are heavy and stuffy, the thick soles result in worse balance and a worse feel of the tarrain, the waterproof material will eventually let in water and then take very long to dry. I don't understand the purpose of "ankle support" for people with healthy legs - it restrains movement and makes you more likely to slip or trip over on uneven surface.
<li>If you choose to buy "outdoor clothing", find something normal-looking, without a visible logo or reflective parts. Then you will feel less like a tourist when wearing it in a city.
<li>Get a 1$ rain poncho or a (more expensive) poncho-tarp. Alteratively, rain jacket + rain skirt or umbrella. Shorts + sandals are a good outfit for rain - they dry quickly and if you keep walking you won't get cold.
<li>Get a space blanket - it costs 1$ and weighs almost nothing.
<li>People laugh at me for using a compass everywhere but it's reliable, fast and doesn't need a battery. Get a tiny one for 1$.
<li>Hat + sunglasses + long sleeve for the sun.
<li>Plug adapters: there are <a href="https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/" target=_blank>many types of sockets</a> but you can survive anywhere with only the "EU" and "US" plugs (and the "AU" plug in a few countries). The "UK" socket can accommodate a EU plug <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi5_CTBnDgc" target=_blank>with a bit of effort</a>. Get a simple, small adapter (<a href="https://www.dhresource.com/0x0s/f2-albu-g5-M01-70-EB-rBVaJFi0KfqAHu21AAEbpXp_5UQ354.jpg/portable-travel-power-plug-adapter-eu-us-au-adaptor-converter-ac-power-plug-european-to-american-outlet-universal.jpg" target=_blank>like this one</a>) as these are the most versatile.
</ul>
CAMPING GEAR<br>
<ul>
<li>Don't bring camping gear "just in case" if you plan to mostly stay in hostels. It may be cheaper to rent it at your destination than to travel with bigger luggage.
<li>Instead of bringing a tent, consider a bivy bag, a hammock, and/or a tarp. They are lighter, less visible, and can be set up in places where a tent can't be, e.g. in a dense forest or at a bus stop.
<li>A mattress may be necessary in cold weather (you lose a lot of heat to the ground). If you don't have one, pitch your tent/bivy on thick grass, lie down on your clothes and your empty backpack. 
<li>Lightweight cooking gear: Make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove" target=_blank>stove from a can</a> (a simple design <a href="https://vimeo.com/64726512" target=_blank>here</a>) and use denatured alcohol as fuel (the higher % ethanol the better). Cook in a metal mug with a lid (or use aluminum foil as lid).
<li>For some gear recommendations, see <a href="https://frugalhiker.blogspot.com/" target=_blank>here</a> or <a href="https://pmags.com/300-gear-challenge" target=_blank>here</a> (or <a href="https://www.thehikinglife.com/2018/04/the-thru-hikers-gear-list-vol-2/" target=_blank>here</a> if you're Bill Gates).
