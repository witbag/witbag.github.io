ACCOMMODATION<br>
<ul>
<li>There's almost never a need to book accommodation in advance.<br>
<li>The cheapest guesthouses are usually not listed online.<br>
<li>Hostels (dormitory room) are the cheapest option in wealthy countries, but not necessarily so in developing countries, were a family-run guesthouse or an old, broken down hotel is often cheaper. People staying at hostels tend to be westerners and it's usually not possible to bargain the price - both these reasons make them more expensive.<br>
<li>Budget accommodation is often concentrated in one part of the city. Ask around or use a map or a guidebook to find where all the hotels are. Go there and make a small tour of the guesthouses. If you're not happy with the price or with the room, visit the place next door.<br>
<li>If you have no idea where to find accommodation, try looking around bus or train stations. Restaurants sometimes have a room for rent, or may know someone who does.<br>
<li>Sleep on trains and buses to save money on accommodation.<br>
</ul>
CAMPING<br>
<ul>
<li>Do your research about where is it allowed to camp. In some countries you may be required to stay at campsites.<br>
<li>If you don't know if you're allowed to camp, make sure you're not in plain sight. Wake up and leave early, ideally before dawn.<br>
<li>In the countryside, try asking farmers if they mind you camping in their field. Some people might let you camp in their front yard.<br>
<li>A campfire makes you very visible. Make sure there are no trees near the fireplace and no branches above it. Don't leave the fire until it is completely out. Never set up fires in a protected area, an urban area, or in someone's field, unless there is a designated spot.<br>
<li>Clean up after yourself and leave no trace. <br>
<li>Don't use any shampoo or soap to wash yourself in nature. Use sand to wash your dishes.<br>
<li>Don't shit near freshwater. Dig a hole and bury it or use public toilets.<br>
</ul>
