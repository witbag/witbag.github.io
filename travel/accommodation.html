<center><h2>Accommodation</h2></center>

<ul>
<li>There's usually no need to book accommodation in advance.<br>
<li>See <a href="resources.html#accom">my list</a> of booking websites, but places not listed online are usually cheaper.<br>
<li>Hostels (dormitory room) are the cheapest option in wealthy countries, but in developing countries, a family-run guesthouse or an old, broken down hotel is often cheaper. Hostels are typically aimed at foreigners and it's usually not possible to bargain the price.<br>
<li>Budget accommodation is often concentrated in one part of the city. Find out where all the hotels are and make a small tour of the guesthouses. If you're not happy with the price or with the room, see the place next door.<br>
<li>If you have no idea where to find accommodation, try looking around bus or train stations. Small restaurants sometimes have a room for rent, or may know someone who does.<br>
<li>Take overnight trains and buses to save money on accommodation.<br>
</ul>
<b>Camping</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Do your research about where is it allowed to camp. In some countries you can only stay at designated campsites.<br>
<li>If you don't know if you're allowed to camp, make sure you're not in plain sight. Wake up and leave early, ideally before dawn.<br>
<li>In the countryside, try asking farmers if they mind you camping in their field.<br>
<li>Be very careful with campfires and avoid them altogether during drought. Make sure there are no branches above or downwind from the fireplace. Don't leave the fire until it is completely out. Find out beforehand if you are allowed to make fire. If you're camping illegally, a campfire is definitely a bad idea.<br>
<li>Clean up after yourself and leave no trace. <br>
<li>Don't use any shampoo or soap to wash yourself in nature. Use sand or grass or leaves to wash dishes.<br>
<li>Don't shit near freshwater. Dig a hole and bury it or use public toilets.<br>
</ul>
