<center><h2>Accommodation</h2></center>

<ul>
<li>Places not listed online are usually the cheapest.<br>
<li>Budget accommodation is often concentrated in one part of the city. Find out where it is and make a small tour of the guesthouses. If you're not happy with the price or with the room, see the place next door.<br>
<li>If you have no idea where to find accommodation, try looking around bus or train stations. Small restaurants sometimes have a room for rent, or may know someone who does.<br>
<li>Take overnight trains and buses to save money on accommodation.<br>
</ul>
<b>Camping</b><br>
<ul>
<li>In some countries you're only allowed to camp at designated campsites.<br>
<li>If you don't know if you're allowed to camp, make sure you're not in plain sight. Wake up and leave before dawn.<br>
<li>In the countryside, try asking farmers if they mind you camping in their field.<br>
<li>Be very careful with campfires and avoid them altogether during drought. If you're camping illegally, a campfire is definitely a bad idea.<br>
<li>Clean up after yourself and leave no trace. <br>
<li>Don't use any shampoo or soap to wash yourself in nature. Use sand or grass or leaves to wash dishes.<br>
<li>Don't shit near freshwater. Dig a hole and bury it or use public toilets.<br>
</ul>
