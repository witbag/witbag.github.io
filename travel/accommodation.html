<center><h2>Accommodation</h2></center>

<ul>
<li>There's usually no need to book accommodation in advance.<br>
<li>See <a href="resources.html#accom">my list</a> of booking websites, but the cheapest guesthouses are usually not listed online.<br>
<li>Hostels (dormitory room) are the cheapest option in wealthy countries, but in developing countries, a family-run guesthouse or an old, broken down hotel is often cheaper. Hostels are typically aimed at foreigners and it's usually not possible to bargain the price.<br>
<li>Budget accommodation is often concentrated in one part of the city. Find out where all the hotels are, go there and make a small tour of the guesthouses. If you're not happy with the price or with the room, see the place next door.<br>
<li>If you have no idea where to find accommodation, try looking around bus or train stations. Small restaurants sometimes have a room for rent, or may know someone who does.<br>
<li>Take overnight trains and buses to save money on accommodation.<br>
</ul>
<b>Camping</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Do your research about where is it allowed to camp. In some countries you can only stay at designated campsites.<br>
<li>If you don't know if you're allowed to camp, make sure you're not in plain sight. Wake up and leave early, ideally before dawn.<br>
<li>In the countryside, try asking farmers if they mind you camping in their field.<br>
<li>A campfire makes you very visible. Make sure there are no trees near the fireplace and no branches above it. Don't leave the fire until it is completely out. Never set up fires in a protected area, an urban area, or in someone's field, unless there is a designated spot.<br>
<li>Clean up after yourself and leave no trace. <br>
<li>Don't use any shampoo or soap to wash yourself in nature. Use sand and leaves to wash dishes.<br>
<li>Don't shit near freshwater. Dig a hole and bury it or use public toilets.<br>
</ul>
