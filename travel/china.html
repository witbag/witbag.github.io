Maps of China: China has its own coordinate system which is offset by a few hundred meters following some complicated formula (apparently to confuse terrorists). Hence, the maps don't align with satellite images or GPS. To view China in the same coordinate system as the rest of the world, use <a href="https://openstreetmap.org" target=_blank>Openstreetmap</a>.<br>
