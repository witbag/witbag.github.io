Maps of China: Since China makes it illegal to publish the actual location of anything on its territory (apparently to confuse terrorists), Chinese maps follow a different coordinate system which is offset by a few hundred meters following some complicated formula. Most online maps (e.g. google) comply with the Chinese law and use their coordinate system. Hence, the maps don't align with satellite images. To view maps of China that follow the same coordinates as the rest of the world, use <a href="https://openstreetmap.org" target=_blank>Openstreetmap</a>.<br>
