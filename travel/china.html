Maps of China: China uses a different coordinate system which is offset by a few hundred meters following some complicated formula (apparently to confuse terrorists). Most online maps (e.g. Google) comply and use the Chinese coordinates for mapping China. This creates massive confusion as the maps don't align with satellite images or GPS. To view China in the same coordinate system as the rest of the world, use <a href="https://openstreetmap.org" target=_blank>Openstreetmap</a>.<br>
