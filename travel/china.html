Maps of China: China has its own coordinate system (apparently to confuse terrorists). The maps that comply with this system (e.g. Google) don't align with satellite images or GPS. To view China in the same coordinate system as the rest of the world, use <a href="https://openstreetmap.org" target=_blank>Openstreetmap</a>.<br>
