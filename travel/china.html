Note: Using maps in China is a nightmare. Since China makes it illegal to publish the actual location of anything on its territory (apparently due to national security concerns), all Chinese maps follow a different coordinate system which is offset by a few hundred meters following a complicated formula. Hence, Chinese maps don't align with satellite images. Most online maps (e.g. google) comply with the Chinese law and use the Chinese coordinate system. To see maps of China that use the same coordinates as the rest of the world, use openstreetmap.org
