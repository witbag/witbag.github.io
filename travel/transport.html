See <a href="resources.html">here</a> for my list of booking websites.<br>
<br>
BUS/MINIVAN<br>
<ul>
<li>There are many different systems. Sometimes you pay online, sometimes at the ticket office, sometimes to the driver, sometimes to the conductor. Sometimes there is a main bus station, sometimes bus companies are scattered around the city. Sometimes there is a schedule, sometimes the buses only leave when full.
<li>The drivers might be competing with each other. They will rush you to their bus/minivan and then you have to wait forever for it to fill up with passengers. To avoid this, get inside buses that look almost full. If there are no passengers inside then it is unlikely to be leaving soon.<br>
<li>Don't get overcharged. If in doubt, ask other passengers what the price is.<br>
</ul>
TRAIN<br>
<ul>
<li>In some countries you need a passport to board the train.
<li>Crossing borders by train is usually much more expensive than buying separate tickets to and from the border.
<li>Rail passes are very popular among backpackers but in most cases they don't save any money.
<li>Best countries for (affordable) train travel. See <a href="https://www.rome2rio.com/" target=_blank>Rome2rio</a> or <a href="https://www.seat61.com/" target=_blank>Seat61</a> for schedules and prices:<br>
- <a href="https://pass.rzd.ru/main-pass/public/en" target=_blank>Russia</a>: Very reliable, free hot water, food vendors. Third-class sleeping berths are great value.<br>
- Former Soviet Union countries: Similar to Russian trains, but sometimes unreliable.<br>
- <a href="https://www.irctc.co.in/" target=_blank>India</a>: Huge network, food vendors, often late. "Unreserved" class can get very crowded.<br>
- China: High-speed trains are expensive, slower sleeper trains are affordable (sell out quickly). <a href="https://www.trip.com/" target=_blank>Schedules</a><br>
- <a href="http://procurement.railway.co.th/checktime/checktime.asp?lenguage=Eng" target=_blank>Thailand</a><br>
- <a href="https://enr.gov.eg/ticketing/public/smartSearch.jsf" target=_blank>Egypt</a><br>
- <a href="https://www.cd.cz/en/default.htm" target=_blank>Czech Republic</a><br>
- <a href="https://www.railway.gov.tw/tra-tip-web/tip?lang=EN_US" target=_blank>Taiwan</a>: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR_Pass#Rail_Pass" target=_blank>TR Pass</a> is a good deal if you're a student.<br>
- Japan: Very expensive, but the <a href="https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/seishun18.html" target=_blank>Seishun 18</a> pass (available few times a year) is a good deal. Also check regional passes.<br>
- Indonesia (only Java): <a href="https://www.traveloka.com/en-id/" target=_blank>Traveloka</a> (booking website)<br>
- <a href="http://www.railway.gov.lk/" target=_blank>Sri Lanka</a>: Can get very crowded.<br>
- <a href="https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html" target=_blank>Italy</a>: Frequent and cheaper than in other Western countries<br>
- <a href="https://rail.cc/en/balkan-flexi-pass" target=_blank>Balkan Flexipass</a> (Bosnia, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Turkey, ferries to Italy): Might save money on longer distances, but the trains are often slow and unreliable.<br>
- <a href="http://www.sncft.com.tn/En/home_46_87" target=_blank>Tunisia</a>: Not very frequent, but cheap.<br>
</ul>
SHARED TAXI<br>
<ul>
<li>It's a bit like hitchhiking but you have to pay. Wave down a passing car or tricycle and say where you want to go. Sometimes there is a government-fixed fare but usually you have to negotiate. The driver will make stops on the way to pick up more passengers. The drivers often wait for passengers at set points, e.g. outside a train or bus station.<br>
</ul>
TAXI/MOTORBIKE TAXI<br>
<ul>
<li>Always negotiate the price in advance or use ride-hailing apps.<br>
<li>Never put your bag in the trunk.<br>
<li>Don't trust the drivers. Better stick to public transport or walking.<br>
</ul>
HITCHHIKING<br>
<ul>
<li>Wait at intersections or places where cars need to slow down. Make sure there is enough space for a car to stop. <br>
<li>It is often better to keep walking down the road instead of waiting in one spot. This signals the drivers that you're not a lazy bum but a serious person who needs to get somewhere and is putting in effort.<br>
<li>Be friendly and ready to chat with the drivers, they are often looking for a good conversation.<br>
<li>Expect to wait longer if you are two or more people.<br>
<li>Don't get in the car if you have a bad feeling about the driver. Make up some excuse (e.g. "I need to wait for my friend").<br>
<li>In many countries, hitchhiking is just a form of public transport and you're supposed to pay (see "shared taxi").<br>
<li>In some cultures the thumbs-up gesture is offensive and a different gesture is used (usually flat extendad hand).<br>
</ul>
FLIGHTS<br>
<ul>
<li>Buying tickets early doesn't always get a better price. Sometimes buying a few weeks or days before the flight is cheaper.<br>
<li>To find a lower price, be flexible with the date and the airport. Consider breaking a longer trip into stages and search them separately.<br>
<li>Make yourself familiar with the <a href="https://www.flightconnections.com" target=_blank>routes</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_low-cost_airlines" target=_blank>low-cost airlines</a>, especially the long-haul ones. Some worth knowing are: <br>

<li>I don't get the point of spending hundreds of dollars on more expensive flights that are "more comfortable". Would you buy a comfortable, 200$ chair if you can only sit in it for a few hours? 
<li>Airlines that provide more legroom fit fewer passengers into their planes, meaning that every passenger generates more carbon emissions. First class travel is the most harmful for the environment.  
<li>For better comfort, try to be the last person to board the plane. Sometimes you can find an empty row for yourself.
<li>Avoid taking taxis directly from/to airports. If there is no decent public transport option, walk a few hundred meters out of the airport area and get a taxi or local bus from there.
