<center><h2>Budget by type of travel</h2></center>
<br>
The costs below assume you move to a different location every day, find the cheapest accommodation, eat simple but healthy food, and visit some tourist attaractions along the way. Range mostly reflects price differences between countries. Costs don't include flights or expensive entertainment, like adventure sports or partying. Worst-case scenario (injury, theft...) is not considered. Also see <a href="money.html">advice on handling money</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Luxury tourist:</b>
<ul>
<li>Budget: at least 400 $/week (all-inclusive)<br>
- Transport: Rented car or tour bus<br>
- Accommodation: Resort or hotel<br>
- Food: At the resort/hotel<br>
<li>Places to go: Stay in resort or hire a guide to go sightseeing<br>
<li>What to pack: Anything you want<br>
<li>Experience: Enjoy the luxury surrounded by other tourists and learn nothing about local life.<br>
</ul>
<b>2. Road trip:</b>
<ul>
<li>Budget: 80-850 $/week <br>
- Transport: 40-300 $/week (car/motorbike)<br>
- Accommodation: 0-250 $/week (camping/hostel/hotel)<br>
- Food: 20-150 $/week (restaurant or groceries)<br>
- Other costs: 20-150 $/week (visas, museums...)<br>
<li>Places to go: Anywhere accessible by road<br>
<li>What to pack: Camping gear, stove, spare parts, etc.<br>
<li>Experience: You have your own schedule, but you give up the freedom to switch between modes of transport, some of which may be more convenient than the one you're stuck with. If you go hiking, you must always return to your starting point. You alienate yourself and miss most of the local experience. Pick up hitchhikers so you don't feel lonely.<br>
</ul>

<li>Budget: 80-750 $/week<br>

- Other costs: 20-150 $/week (visas, museums...)<br>
<li>Places to go: Anywhere accessible by road<br>

<li>What to pack: If traveling alone, bring a bivy/hammock/tarp instead of a tent. Leave enough space in your bag for food and water. <a href="packing.html">Packing suggestions</a><br>
<li>Experience: You will suffer but you will have a chance to visit places out of reach for other travelers. You need to be relatively fit and in good health.<br>
