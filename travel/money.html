<b>Handling money:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Find a bank that has no international transaction fees or ATM fees. ING, Citibank in Australia, many credit unions in the USA.
<li>Some ATMs will ask if you wish to be charged in local currency or in your bank's currency. Always choose local currency to avoid rip-off rates.
<li>Avoid exchanging cash in Western countries, especially at airports (terrible rates). Some countries have "black market" rates which are better than official ones (bring 100 USD bills for best rates) but watch out for scams.
<li>Keep coins and small bills for daily expenses seperate from large bills and other valuables (e.g. in a different pocket).
<li>Wallets are easily spotted by thieves. Don't carry any large money in a wallet.
<li>Usually it is safer to leave valuable items at the hotel than to carry them with you. 
<li>Keep some emergency cash somewhere well hidden, just in case. 
</ul>
<b>Some tips on saving money:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>To have money for travel, focus on saving it in expensive countries, not in cheap countries (especially if you live in an expensive country).
<li>Avoid staying in touristy areas.
<li>If you live in an expensive city, renting out your room while you're away can often save enough money to cover your entire trip.
<li>If you are a student, a teacher, or under 31, get an ISIC/ITIC/IYTC card. It includes travel insurance and some discounts. Costs about 25$.
</ul>
