<b>Handling money:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Find a bank that has no international ATM fees (ING, Citibank in Australia, many credit unions in the USA).
<li>Some ATMs will ask if you wish to be charged in local currency or in your bank's currency. Choose local currency to avoid horrible rates.
<li>Avoid exchanging cash in Western countries (bad rates). Some countries have "black market" rates which are better than official ones (100 USD bills get best rates).
<li>Keep coins and small bills for daily expenses seperate from large bills and other valuables (e.g. in a different pocket).
<li>Wallets are easily spotted by thieves. Don't carry any large money in a wallet.
<li>Usually it is safer to leave valuable items at the hotel than to carry them with you. 
<li>Keep some emergency cash somewhere well hidden, just in case. 
</ul>
<b>Some tips on saving money:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Be stingy in expensive countries, not in cheap countries (especially if you live in an expensive country).
<li>Avoid staying in touristy areas.
<li>If you live in an expensive city, renting out your room while you're away could save enough money to cover your entire trip.
<li>If you are a student, a teacher, or under 31, get an ISIC/ITIC/IYTC card. It includes travel insurance and some discounts. Costs about 25$.
</ul>
