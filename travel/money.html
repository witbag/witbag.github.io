<center><h2>Money and travel</h2></center>
<br>
<b>Handling money</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Keep coins and small bills for daily expenses seperate from large bills and other valuables (e.g. in a different pocket).
<li>Wallets are easily spotted by thieves. Don't carry any large money in a wallet.
<li>Usually it is safer to leave valuable items at the hotel than to carry them with you. 
<li>Keep some emergency cash somewhere well hidden, just in case. 
</ul>
<br>
<b>Budget by type of travel</b><br>
<br>
These budgets should be sufficient for independent travel. Costs don't include flights or expensive entertainment (adventure sports, partying...). Worst-case scenario (injury, theft...) is not considered. Range mostly reflects price differences between countries.<br>
<br>
1. Luxury tourist:
<ul>
<li>Budget: at least 400 $/week (all-inclusive)<br>
- Transport: Rented car or tour bus<br>
- Accommodation: Resort or hotel<br>
- Food: At the resort/hotel<br>
<li>Places to go: Stay in resort or hire a guide to go sightseeing<br>
<li>What to pack: Anything you want<br>
<li>Experience: Enjoy the luxury surrounded by other tourists and learn nothing about local life.<br>
</ul>
2. Road trip:
<ul>
<li>Budget: 80-850 $/week <br>
- Transport: 40-300 $/week (car/motorbike)<br>
- Accommodation: 0-250 $/week (camping/hostel/hotel)<br>
- Food: 20-150 $/week (restaurant or groceries)<br>
- Other costs: 20-150 $/week (visas, museums...)<br>
<li>Places to go: Anywhere accessible by road<br>
<li>What to pack: Camping gear, stove, spare parts, etc.<br>
<li>Experience: You have your own schedule, but you give up the freedom to switch between modes of transport, some of which may be more convenient than the one you're stuck with. If you go hiking, you must always return to your starting point. You alienate yourself and miss most of the local experience. Pick up hitchhikers so you don't feel lonely.<br>
</ul>
3. Backpacker:
<ul>
<li>Budget: 80-750 $/week<br>
- Transport: 20-200 $/week (public transport/walk. Sometimes rent a bicycle or a motorbike. Avoid taxis as much as possible). <a href="transport.html">Read more</a><br>
- Accommodation: 20-250 $/week (hostel/budget hotel/stay with friends/couchsurfing. Overnight bus or train). <a href="accommodation.html">Read more</a><br>
- Food: 20-150 $/week (restaurant or groceries)<br>
- Other costs: 20-150 $/week (visas, museums...)<br>
<li>Places to go: Anywhere accessible by road<br>
<li>What to pack: A small bag. Something to read. Bring camping gear only if you really plan on camping. <a href="packing.html">Packing suggestions</a><br>
<li>Experience: Depends on your attitude and your luck (tip: be flexible and improvise).<br>
</ul>
4. Adventurer/explorer/hobo:
<ul>
<li>Budget: 0-250 $/week<br>
- Transport: 0-50 $/week (walk/hitchhike/bicycle/kayak/horseback/etc). <a href="transport.html">Hitchhiking tips</a><br>
- Accommodation: 0-50 $/week (camping, squatting, etc.). <a href="accommodation.html">Advice on camping</a>. If you worry about not showering, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/i-stopped-showering-and-life-continued/486314" target=_blank>read here.</a><br>
- Food: 0-50 $/week (groceries, foraging, dumpster diving)<br>
- Other costs: 0-100 $/week (visas, permits...)<br>
<li>Places to go: Anywhere, but this is the best way to see real wilderness that others can't access. Be aware that in some countries you can't visit national parks without a guide and/or an expensive enterance ticket.<br>
<li>What to pack: If traveling alone, bring a bivy/hammock/tarp instead of a tent. Leave enough space in your bag for food and water. <a href="packing.html">Packing suggestions</a><br>
<li>Experience: You will suffer but you will have a chance to visit places out of reach for other travelers. You need to be relatively fit and in good health.<br>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Tips on saving money</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Avoid staying in touristy areas.
<li>Use a bank card that has no international ATM fees (ING, Citibank in Australia, many credit unions in the USA).
<li>Some ATMs will ask if you wish to be charged in local currency or in your bank's currency. Choose local currency to avoid being ripped off.
<li>Avoid exchanging cash in Western countries (terrible rates). Some countries have "black market" rates which are better than official ones (100 USD bills get best rates).
<li>Spend or exchange all local money before leaving a developing country - it will be practically worthless anywhere else.
<li>Don't be too stingy in cheap countries. Better spend money there than back in your expensive country.
<li>If you live in an expensive city, renting out your room while you're away can probably save enough money to cover your entire trip.
<li>If you are a student, a teacher, or under 31, get an ISIC/ITIC/IYTC card. It includes travel insurance and some discounts. Costs about 25$.
