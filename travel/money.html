<center><h2>Money and travel</h2></center>
<br>
<b>Handling money</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Keep coins and small bills for daily expenses seperate from large bills and other valuables (e.g. in a different pocket).
<li>Wallets are easily spotted by thieves. Don't carry any large money in a wallet.
<li>Usually it is safer to leave valuable items at the hotel than to carry them with you. 
<li>Keep some emergency cash somewhere well hidden, just in case. 
</ul>
<b>Tips on saving money</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Avoid staying in touristy areas.
<li>Use a bank card that has no international payment fees or ATM fees.
<li>Some ATMs will ask if you wish to be charged in local currency or in your bank's currency. Choose local currency to avoid being ripped off.
<li>Avoid exchanging cash in Western countries (terrible rates). Some countries have "black market" rates which are better than official ones (100 USD bills get best rates).
<li>Spend or exchange all local money before leaving a developing country - it will be practically worthless anywhere else.
<li>Don't be too stingy in cheap countries. Better spend money there than back in your expensive country.
<li>If you live in an expensive city, renting out your room while you're away can probably save enough money to cover your entire trip.
</ul>
<b>Travel insurance</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Some countries require you to have insurance to get a visa.
<li>If you are a student, a teacher, or under 31, get an ISIC/ITIC/IYTC card. It includes travel insurance and some discounts. Costs about 25$.
<li>If you plan on hiking, some insurance companies classify it as an "extreme" sport and won't cover any accidents. Most insurance policies have a maximum altitude limit, sometimes ridiculously low.
